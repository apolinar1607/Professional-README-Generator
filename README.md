  ## Installation
  
  To built this application, I initialized the package.json file using 'npm init' command. Secondly, I installed the inquirer npm package using "npm install"command. In addtion, I also utilized some open tools like shield.io to build the license badge, choosealicense.com to generate license terms. More importantly, I used node.js to run the application and to generate the README.md file.
